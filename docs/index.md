## Final assignment

At the end of this module, you are challenged to put the lessons learned into practice. Given the knowledge you have gained during this module, can you come up with interesting and non-trivial refactoring candidates for an existing code base? Can you describe and argue what steps would make a code-base better – in terms of maintainability, readability, flexibility, or transferability?

Find a code base for your analysis. You can use your own code base from last semester, but you are also free to find one of github. Make a short description of the context in which this code base is developed, which problem it tries to solve and in what way it succeeds in doing so (if at all).

Next, come up with a static code analysis in which you describe the current state of the code base. Think about the steps we took in [exercise 1](exercise1.md). After you have done this, you should be able to identify and describe certain [code smells](https://python.astrotech.io/devops/good-engineering-practice/code-smells.html). Describe these smells (in somewhat detail, including the programming code) and make suggestions for improvements.

All this should return in a small report of about five to ten pages (including images and code listings). You don't have to perform the refactoring – a description will suffice.
